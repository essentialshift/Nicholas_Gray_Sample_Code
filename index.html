        <div class="text">Having extensive graphic design skills, in addition to his top-notch web development skills, he was truly an added bonus and allowed full website development projects to be completed more efficiently. Nick’s professionalism, expert WordPress knowledge, calm demeanor in the face of stressful clients and deadlines, as well as his “outside of the box thinking” were truly a blessing. Nick’s ability to manipulate existing themes and plugins, in addition to creating custom implementations, allowed our company to extend our capabilities and provide our clients with better web solutions than previous.<br />- Ron LiVigni</div>
